GreenBlackTheme 

27 years of this color scheme for seasons of 12+ hour days. Zero degradation in vision. 
Fully green for primary text elements, fully black for backgrounds. Syntax highlighting with a lean towards green.

Current approach is a simple merging of the best parts of the 
RBE Matrix skin theme - truly, predominantly green 
Hacker Dark Pro - Syntax highlighting for python and others. Chats, agents, with appropriate colors

Specifically designed for a 3-panel approach with minimal VSCode UI. 
No status bars, no tab bars, no title bars, as close to full screen as possible in i3wm.
